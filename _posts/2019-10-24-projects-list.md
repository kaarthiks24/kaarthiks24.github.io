### Automatic Gas Leak Detection and Level Monitoring System using Arduino

• Constructed an IOT device to mitigate domestic gas leak accidents and monitor gas levels in the cylinder buttressed on SQLite DB. Executed on Arduino platform with SONAR sensor estimating gas level forecasting the duration with the previous usage data
• Got accolades from professors as an essential initiative to contribute back to society
• Utilized the MMS to facilitate notification based alerts when gas leakage is diagnosed.
