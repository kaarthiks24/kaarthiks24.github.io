**Compilation of personal and professional projects and learnings**


### [National Identity Card Security System with Real-time Facial Recognition]("https://github.com/kaarthiks24/kaarthiks24.github.io/blob/master/assets/projects/National%20Identity%20Card%20Security%20System%20with%20Real-time%20Facial%20Recognition.md")

• Collaborated in a team of two arbitrating project flow and programmed an application to enhance user identity authentication
• Developed a deep learning model using Convolutional neural network (CNN) and Haar-cascade with an accuracy of 92.3%
• Surpassed offline verification issue by modeling the application as Software as a Service (SAAS) working on both online and offline
• Implemented the project in Tkinter framework and hosted it in Firebase
• Received highest grade among 100 teams in university

### IOT-Based Driver Drowsiness Detection System

• Involved in a team of three and built a real-time driver's drowsiness alert system. Engineered solution on Raspberry pi platform
• Formulated an Machine learning algorithm with Eye-aspect ratio (EAR) and Frontal Haar (Open CV)
• Modeled a system loading the ML algorithm in the IOT device and hosted in AWS EC2

### Automatic Gas Leak Detection and Level Monitoring System using Arduino

• Constructed an IOT device to mitigate domestic gas leak accidents and monitor gas levels in the cylinder buttressed on SQLite DB. Executed on Arduino platform with SONAR sensor estimating gas level forecasting the duration with the previous usage data
• Got accolades from professors as an essential initiative to contribute back to society
• Utilized the MMS to facilitate notification based alerts when gas leakage is diagnosed.


### A Full-Stack E-commerce Website

[This is a link to a different site](https://deanattali.com/) and [this is a link to a section inside this page](#local-urls).

• Built a full stack website with Django as backend and REACT as front end. Wrote API to connect between back and frontend
• Created a Mongo DB to handle all the unstructured data
• Added payment gateway to expedite the orders
• Conceptualized the need for a medium for buying and selling goods from various vendors and customers as an E-commerce website
