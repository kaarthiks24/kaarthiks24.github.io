### Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection System

• Devised a machine learning-based system to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, addressing the challenge of a heavily skewed dataset by implementing the SMOTE method for data balancing.
• Through rigorous experimentation and parameter fine-tuning, achieved an exceptional accuracy of 99% using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), surpassing alternative models including SVM and random forest.
