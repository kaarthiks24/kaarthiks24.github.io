### National Identity Card Security System with Real-time Facial Recognition

• Collaborated in a team of two arbitrating project flow and programmed an application to enhance user identity authentication
• Developed a deep learning model using Convolutional neural network (CNN) and Haar-cascade with an accuracy of 92.3%
• Surpassed offline verification issue by modeling the application as Software as a Service (SAAS) working on both online and offline
• Implemented the project in Tkinter framework and hosted it in Firebase
• Received highest grade among 100 teams in university
