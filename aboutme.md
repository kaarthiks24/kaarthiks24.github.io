### My story

A driven student with a strong educational background in computer science. Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at the esteemed Stevens Institute of Technology, where I have consistently achieved exceptional grades, maintaining a GPA of 3.94/4. My coursework, including "Math Foundation of Machine Learning," "Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining," and "Data Structures and Algorithms," has provided me with a solid foundation for my journey in data science.

My academic pursuits have closely aligned with the skills I've cultivated. Proficient in Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL, I've applied these languages to create real-world solutions. For instance, I developed a credit card fraud detection system that achieved an outstanding 99% accuracy rate by skillfully employing machine learning algorithms, tightly connecting my skills to a tangible project outcome.

During my internship at Synechron Inc, I gained invaluable experience in the realm of generative AI. I conducted a case study on Large Language Models (LLM), including GPT, Llama, and Falcon, which significantly enhanced their natural language comprehension and generation capabilities. I also implemented impactful chunking strategies in embedding models, directly improving LLM accuracy. This experience is a prime example of how my academic background translated into hands-on expertise.

I'm excited to further develop my skills and make a meaningful impact in the data science field. Let's connect to discuss how my academic foundation, strong skill set, and internship experience can contribute to innovative projects and drive advancements in generative AI and data science.
